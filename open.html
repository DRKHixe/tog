            <b class="heading">TOPIC:</b> THE MEANING OF LIFE<br>
            <strong class="heading">MEMORISE:</strong>
            And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. John 6:35<br>
             <strong class="heading">READ:</strong>  John 10:9-10 (KJV) <br>
             9. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br>
             10. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br>
             <p><strong class="heading"> BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: Matthew  21-22</strong></p>
            <p>
                <b class="heading">Open Heaven For Today 2024 MESSAGE</b><br>
                Many people have sought to find out the real meaning and essence of life. I have discovered that the only thing that gives life meaning is a relationship with Jesus Christ. Without Christ, life has no meaning. Without Christ, a man is like a boat, rocked back and forth by the waves of this world.<br>
                He may pursue a variety of personal objectives, amass wealth, achieve success in one field or the other, or gain pleasure in one thing or another, but soon he will discover that they are all momentary and unsatisfying without Christ. No matter how rich you become, Ecclesiastes 5:10 says that money doesn’t satisfy. In Christ, you have everything you need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3)<br>
                In Ephesians 2:1, Apostle Paul referred to those without Christ as being ‘dead in trespasses and sins’. He said in verse 3 that they fulfil the desires of the flesh, and if anyone has lived long enough, he or she would have discovered that the desires of the flesh do not bring satisfaction. At the end of the day, what people need to gain the joy that they seek is to satisfy the burning desire to connect with their Maker, the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
                Until that is done, they will always feel empty. Cars, awards, titles, and all the money in this world can never fill that void in their hearts. Until they have a relationship with Christ, their lives will remain meaningless. This is why when people become born again, all of a sudden, they feel this inner peace that cannot be explained. What follows after is joy. Life now suddenly has a meaning.<br>
                Beloved, make Christ your top priority. Don’t trade Him for money or anything else because it will profit you nothing if you gain the whole world and lose your soul (Matthew 16:26). People who do not have Christ will not only live a life of depression and chaos on earth, but they will also suffer for eternity in hell.<br>
                The worst thing about hell is not the unquenchable fire and undying worms that will torture its occupants (Mark 9:48); it is the eternal separation from God and the regret of choosing to continue in sin despite hearing several messages of God’s salvation. Save yourself from that torment by giving your life to Christ now if you haven’t done so, and ensure you live holy henceforth.

                <b class="heading">Hymn 16 – In Christ Alone </b><br>
                <p><br>
                    1. In Christ alone, my hope is found<br>
                    He is my light, my strength, my song<br>
                    This Cornerstone, this solid ground<br>
                    Firm through the fiercest drought and storm<br>
                    What heights of love, what depths of peace<br>
                    When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br>
                    My Comforter, my All in All<br>
                    Here in the love of Christ I stand.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh<br>
                    Fullness of God in helpless babe<br>
                    This gift of love and righteousness<br>
                    Scorned by the ones He came to save<br>
                    ‘Til on that cross as Jesus died<br>
                    The wrath of God was satisfied<br>
                    For every sin on Him was laid<br>     
                    Here in the death of Christ I live, I live
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    3.There in the ground His body lay<br>
                    Light of the world by darkness slain<br>
                    Then bursting forth in glorious Day<br>
                    Up from the grave He rose again<br>
                    And as He stands in victory<br>
                    Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me<br>
                    For I am His and He is mine<br>
                    Bought with the precious blood of Christ
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    4.No guilt in life, no fear in death<br>
                    This is the power of Christ in me<br>
                    From life’s first cry to final breath<br>
                    Jesus commands my destiny<br>
                    No power of hell, no scheme of man<br>
                    Can ever pluck me from His hand<br>
                    Till He returns or calls me home<br>
                    Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand
                </p><br>
